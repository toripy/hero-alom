            <p>Earlier in my life, I have been employed selling CDs and later started a satellite TV connection business. I began making music videos as a hobby. Some of my music videos went viral in 2015, and I became a popular target of online trolling and a popular subject of memes in Bangladesh. As of December 2018, I have acted in one feature film. A Hindi play based on Alom, directed by NSD-graduate Mahesh Ruprao Ghodeswar, was staged in 2019, in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. It is a fictionalised bio-play.</p>
